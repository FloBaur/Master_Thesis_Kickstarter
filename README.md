# Master_Thesis_Kickstarter

This Programm helps to analyse certain data from Kickstarter Projekts.
In the first step the data gets load from the DataSource folder where the Programm expects a .csv file from Webrobots.io.
Any filter criteria can be set in Filter.py to extract relevant data. There is already some example data in the stack for linear regression analysis.
The results will be printed in Data -> results folder as csv file. If new Data is requested, pay attention to the newest version of Selenium Webdrivers.
Also a valid Microsoft Azure Account is required for the KI-analysis of the crawled Data.

In summary a simple automatication for crawling and analyse some data for mainly scientivic purposes.
